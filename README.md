Its an simple web application that changes the background color of the webpage.

***Just a bit of explanation :***
In **hex.js** file it just randomly creates the color code and assigns it to `document.body.style.color`
In **index.js** file it just randomly picks one color from given array and assigns it to `document.body.style.color`
